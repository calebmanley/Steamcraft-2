Cloning this repository
-----------------------

1. Download the newest version of Forge for Minecraft 1.6.4 from here: <http://files.minecraftforge.net>, and extract somewhere convenient for you.
2. Run the necessary commands to decompile it (just like you would set it up normally).
    - Note: if you do not know how to do this, please check a Forge MCP installation tutorial.
3. Download Eclipse Kepler here: <http://www.eclipse.org/kepler/>. It already has EGit built-in for simplicity. 
4. Open Eclipse Kepler and choose your workspace: navigate to your forge directory. Then, /mcp/eclipse. Accept that as your workspace. Keep Eclipse open.
5. Create a temporary folder on your desktop. Navigate to /forge/mcp/src/minecraft and move all of the files in the /minecraft directory into your temporary folder.
6. Now delete that original /minecraft folder inside /src, and create a new /minecraft folder inside that /src folder.
7. Now go back to Eclipse (ignore the errors), and in the 'Quick Access' field, type Git. A couple of options should pop up.
8. Under 'Commands,' click 'Clone a Git Repository.'
9. Enter the HTTPS clone URL code into the URI field: <https://github.com/MrArcane111/Steamcraft-2.git>. All the other info should fill in automatically.
10. Click 'Next.' Click 'Next' again.
11. Now, for the Directory, click 'Browse,' and navigate to /forge/mcp/src/minecraft (it should be that new minecraft folder you created). Remove the "Steamcraft-2" project name at the end of the file browse. Click 'Finish'.
12. Now, type Git again into the 'Quick Access' field. 
13. Under 'Perspectives,' choose 'Git Repository Exploring.'
    - Note: to configure your views, you will need to play around with them. Google is your friend.
14. In the 'Git Repository Exploring' view, right-click the 'minecraft' project, and then click 'Pull.' This will submit a pull request to me.
15. Once 'Pull' is clicked and you have the necessary permissions, stuff will download into your Minecraft project. 
16. Now you can edit stuff and commit any new changes I approve!
    - I suggest reading tutorials about using Github before contributing to this repo.
